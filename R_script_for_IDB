##Right lets tackle isolation by distance

##load the required packages

library("ape")
library("pegas")
library("seqinr")
library("ggplot2")
library("adegenet")

library(readr)

##### NOW WORKING ON POPS WITH GPS COORDINATES, REMOVED=FR,SP,SO,RR,CD,WM,SM

##imports genpop formated indv genotype
BHS_indv_genotypes_with_GPS <- read.genepop(file = "adegenet_BHS_individual_genotypes_input_with_GPS.gen",ncode = 2,quiet = TRUE)

#checks indv genotype file is suitable
is.genind(BHS_indv_genotypes_with_GPS)

##lists properties of the gen indvs
BHS_indv_genotypes_with_GPS


##########add in the pops

##convert indv genotypes to pop ~genotypes 
BHS_pops <- genind2genpop(BHS_indv_genotypes_with_GPS)

##check pop names
popNames(BHS_pops)

###check BHS_pops
BHS_pops

###import pop coordinates
BHS_pop_coordinates <- read.csv(file ="IBD_genpop_lat_long_NOPOP.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",")

###set coordinates for genpop file
BHS_pops@other$latlong<-BHS_pop_coordinates

##################right lets make an IBD for POPS 

##make the geographic distance matrix, note us @other rather than $other (error in the manual)
BHS_geog_dist <-dist(BHS_pops@other$latlong)

##make the genetic distance matrix
BHS_pops_gen_dist <-dist.genpop(BHS_pops, method = 2)

##do the mantel test
BHS_ibd <-mantel.randtest(m1 = BHS_pops_gen_dist, m2 = BHS_geog_dist,nrepet = 10000)

###lets have a gander at it 
plot(BHS_ibd)
##not really what we're looking for 

####lets have a go at this
plot(BHS_geog_dist,BHS_pops_gen_dist)
##BETER
#plot(BHS_pops_gen_dist,BHS_geog_dist)

##this looks kinda sketchy, not sure if its right
#abline(lm(BHS_geog_dist~BHS_pops_gen_dist),col="red")
abline(lm(BHS_pops_gen_dist~BHS_geog_dist),col="red")

BHS_ibd

#BHS_IBD_regression<-lm(BHS_geog_dist~BHS_pops_gen_dist)

#BHS_IBD_coeff=coefficients(BHS_IBD_regression)

# equation of the line : 
#eq = paste0("y = ", round(BHS_IBD_coeff[2],1), "*x ", round(BHS_IBD_coeff[1],1))# equation of the line : 
#plot(BHS_geog_dist,BHS_pops_gen_dist, main=eq)
